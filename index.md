## About the Project

This was an invite-only project designed by my AP Computer Science teacher for the top two performing students in each of his classes. The APCS cirriculum taught Java programming language, but this project was in Python. Furthermore, this project focussed on Lambda functions. Students were expected to have no programming experience in Python, and were to code only in terminal. IDEs were restricted so students could find and resolve errors by themselves.

Terminal ran Python 3.7 at the time of this project. Students would store code on an external application such as Notes, Word Document, or Google Docs. 

## Starting the Project

Students were first taught what lambda functions were: small functions that could take _n_ number of arguments, but can only have one expression. Next, students were shown an example of very basic functions:
```markdown
f = lambda x: 2 * x // returns the product of 2 and any given number
```



## Challenges

- Terminal is not very user friendly
- Lambda Functions could only be a single line of code
- 

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/joshuajerome/joshuajerome.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
